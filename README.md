Configured switches, routers, DHCP Server, DNS Server, Email Server, Web Server, implemented a DMZ (Demilitarized Zone)/screened subnet, and documented processes and configurations for transparency and knowledge sharing
Configured firewall rules to regulate outgoing traffic from the university network and DMZ, restricting access based on predefined policies. Implemented strict access controls to permit some traffic to the DMZ while blocking unauthorized access from external sources
Demonstrated proficiency in network design principles, routing protocols, firewall configuration, and security best practices through hands-on project execution
